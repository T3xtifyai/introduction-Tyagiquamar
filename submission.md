## My Submission:

Here is my power point presentation for the monetization strategy for B2C AI Solutions. It is the link to the file uploaded in the repository. 

In this presentation, I have mentioned the various monetization strategies that can employed by anyone. And I have sorted the general list available publicly 
tailored to the specific need. I also suggest implementation of all methods in the order of product marketing where, in the first step we need to grab capital 
for building the product. One way to do that is to **ADVERTISE** on our platform to make some commission amount (method 1). Then we can 
put in some small additional boost for sale within the platform which are know an **IN-APP PURCHASES** (method 2).
